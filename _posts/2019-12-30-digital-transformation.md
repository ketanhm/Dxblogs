As 2019 closes, and I reflect on my conversations this year with Functional/Technology leaders, the value of “Digital Business” couldn’t be clearer. "Digital Transformation" is the drive to improve “Top line” and “Bottom line” by re-imagining current business and improving its performance, using software/digital technologies as enablers.

Across industries (Financial Services, Retail, Hi-Tech Manufacturing and Retail-CPG), digital technologies helped achieve 3 key business imperatives & Transformations:

# Improving Customer "Experience"
   
Helping build a connected experience by providing contextual & continuous (personalized, omni channel) and capability-rich journeys (API’s to internal/external application, connecting front/Middle/back office, increasing digital/self-service over in-person/voice) to Customers (partners, employees).

Retail: Enabling customers to “Buy online Pickup in Store (BOPIS)” and “Buy Online Return in Store (BORIS); helping reduce shipment costs, increase in-store traffic and impulse buying

Digital Finance - A home buyer using mobile device to ‘Explore’, ‘Research’, and do a Quick Application for mortgage; using Web to ‘Complete’ application, uploading documents, visiting a Brick-Mortar office to ‘Close’: and using mobile/web to staying ‘Engaged’ post move-in to new home

# Becoming "Data" Driven 
Analyzing years of customer data (disparate systems) and making it available across applications/users to improve customer experience, increasing operations efficiencies and launch new revenue/growth opportunities. Applying AI/ML to personalize customer care, increasing productivity, targeted campaigns, reducing churn and others.

Online Brokerage: machine learning algorithms for data-driven goal planning, rebalancing, and diversification

Online Lender: approving loans online in sub-seconds, using data models for credit risks, fraud prevention

Hi-Tech Manufacturer: Improving supply chain efficiencies

Hotel Chain: a data repository that can service guest profile data to various application (mobile, web, front-desk, guest care/contact center) with a sub-second response

# Running "Platforms" - Least cost, most available and scalable 
With maturing of cloud offerings, Enterprises are using a mix of OnPrem, Cloud-based and SaaS Infrastructure. These has created a need of being able to opportunistically move workloads across infra by utilizing micro-services and containerization.

High Availability Application: Running it on a private PaaS solution to meet objective of reducing infra cost, responding to market/volume spikes, RTO <3 Hours, RPO<3 hours, RCO of 50%

# Digital Transformation in 2020 and beyond
As we began our next decade, some of the current buzz-words/pitches will gain solid traction and become widely adopted. Digital transformation will continue and the push to improve “Top Line” and “Bottom Line” continues. And at end of 2020, I wish I have successful use-cases to share with digital technologies such as:

## IoT
Sensors and applications to monitor goods through the supply chain, logistics, food safety, asset tracking, smart tags to thwart counterfeiting

## VR/AR
Provide rich customer experience at each stage of their journey. A step towards experience economy

## Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Better response to human interactions and drive higher customer satisfaction

## Robotic process automation (RPA)
F&A/HR/Supply Chain processes have seen the benefits. It will see more usage in core areas; Banks/Finance – bring down compliance/regulatory costs; Retail/CPG: Automate trade promotions, in-store planning
