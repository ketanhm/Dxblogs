Fintech drove the financial services industry transformation by adopting to consumer digital experience expectations and data-driven innovations. Traditional universal banking providers were more focused on meeting regulations/compliance and few did create digital innovation teams (checkmark to boards). However, markets are fast-moving and it appears that Fintech is on a path of rebundling financial services. Till now revenues and market share of all participants have increased, but if there are universal Fintechs (or a Big Tech jumps in), then the financial services market is going to structurally change for benefit of consumer.

# Universal financial service provider


1. Providers strived to offer bundled products and services on disparate, legacy platforms
* Individual LOB platforms, individual consumer facing SoR, few common Platforms, LOB infra platforms - structured around bank’s delivery channels

2. FANG++ set consumer's digital expectations
* Fintech understood consumer pain, addressed friction points, and unbundled banks by offering any-time, any-where, any-device delivery of its services

# Fintech unbundled the bank
