Fintech drove the financial services industry transformation by adopting to consumer digital experience expectations and data-driven innovations. Traditional universal banking providers were more focused on meeting regulations/compliance and few did create digital innovation teams (checkmark to boards). However, markets are fast-moving and it appears that Fintech is on a path of rebundling financial services. Till now revenues and market share of all participants have increased, but if there are universal Fintechs (or a Big Tech jumps in), then the financial services market is going to structurally change for benefit of consumer.
