Broadly this area is called Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC). When GRC role is functionally  - Finance & Audit GRC, Technology GRC, and Legal GRC.

Each function and its business managers need to make choices of technology/systems (ideally with CIO office involvement) to mitigate risks and ensure compliance.

To understand the impact of adverse event, one needs to establish the link between technology risk scenarios and ultimate business impact. There are several approaches that can help enterprise describe IT risk in business terms. 

ISACA’s RiskIT framework does not prescribe which framework to use for risk evaluation. One of risk evaluation framework classifies four business (application) risks--Availability, Access, Accuracy, and Agility (4A1 Framework). 

Enterprise needs to also build (& continuously evolve) in 3 core disciplines – technology foundation, risk governance process, and risk aware culture. Executed well, enterprise builds effective risk management capability, and derives strategic business value.
