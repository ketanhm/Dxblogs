Smaller agile teams can be high-touch collaborative. Large enterprise agile software team are distributed (typically global). The trade-off (of co-location) is done at these large enterprises as they: operate in global markets, leverage global talent pool, and want to contain cost.

While going agile, enterprise watch out for:

- No tracking of what is done, where, when, how (Audit Risk â€“ in regulated industries)
- Burned out staff
